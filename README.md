# QUEUE-IN-JACK
Queue . enqueue, dequeue, Front, Rear, size. 

Making a new Queue of Capacity 5 first. Here, we're testing the four criteria to see if the queue meets its requirements.
First, we add four elements (1, 2, 3, and 4) in that order, and then we use Display() to print the elements of the queue to see if they have been added.
Using Display() to output the elements in the queue, we are removing a second member and determining whether the first element has been removed.
Third, if more elements are added to a queue, add 5 items (2, 3, 4, 5, 6), in that order, to a queue that can hold 5 elements, and then add 1 more element to see if the queue is about to bounce.

The string is empty if the fourth isEmpty check, which removes all the elements, is true.
